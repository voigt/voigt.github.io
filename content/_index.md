Iâ€™m Christoph Voigt, an experienced software engineer, consultant, manager & entrepreneur with more than 10 years of industry experience. 

I focused my career around [#containers](/tags/containers/) ([#kubernetes](/tags/kubernetes/) *\*cough\**), [#golang](/tags/golang/) and cloud infrastructure. I'm furthermore enthusiastic for [#rust](/tags/rust), [#zig](/tags/zig/) and [#wasm](/tags/wasm/).

Together with some friends I founded **Liquid Reply GmbH**, a consultancy specialized in cloud-provider agnostic infrastructure.
