Iâ€™m Christoph Voigt, an experienced software engineer, consultant, manager & entrepreneur with more than 10 years of industry experience. 

I focused my career around [#containers](http://localhost:1313/tags/containers/) ([#kubernetes](http://localhost:1313/tags/kubernetes/) *\*cough\**), [#golang](http://localhost:1313/tags/golang/) and cloud infrastructure. I'm furthermore enthusiastic for [#rust](http://localhost:1313/tags/rust), [#zig](http://localhost:1313/tags/zig/) and [#wasm](http://localhost:1313/tags/wasm/).

Together with some friends I founded **Liquid Reply GmbH**, a consultancy specialized in cloud-provider agnostic infrastructure.
