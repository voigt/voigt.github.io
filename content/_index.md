I am Christoph Voigt, a software engineer, consultant, manager, and entrepreneur, boasting over a decade of experience in the industry.
{{< /lead >}}

Throughout my career, I have dedicated my efforts to working with [#containers](/tags/containers/), [#kubernetes](/tags/kubernetes/), [#golang](/tags/golang/) and cloud infrastructure. Additionally, I am passionate about [#rust](/tags/rust), [#zig](/tags/zig/) and [#wasm](/tags/wasm/).

In collaboration with a group of colleagues, I co-founded **Liquid Reply GmbH**, a consultancy that specializes in cloud-provider agnostic infrastructure.
