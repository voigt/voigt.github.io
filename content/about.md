## 👨🏼‍💻 I code.

- I write code in various languages, but mostly in Go.

## 🏃 I run.

- I started running in 2022 with the goal of running a half-marathon. Unfortunately, illness and injuries intervened and prevented progress. Unfortunately, illness and injuries intervened and prevented progress. Therefore, I have so far only [unofficially run a half-marathon](https://www.strava.com/activities/8079748572/overview). But it will come fore sure. In the mean time you can follow my progress on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/11472957).

## 📖 I read.

- My all-time favourite things on the internet can be found [here](/links). If you read them and like them, tweet me and tell me! I'd love to chat about them with you.

## An incomplete list of things I used to do, but don't do anymore:

- **Hannover Gophers**  
Together with Tobias Pauling I ran the Hannover Gophers meetup. Unfortunately, the pandemic killed it and we decided to quit.
- **nativecloud.dev**  
Together with Max Körbächer we ran a weekly newsletter about Cloud-Native Software, Culture and Practices. After two years we decided to stop the newsletter to leave time for other projects.
- **Kubernetes Release Team**  
I contributed to the Kubernetes Release Team. I was a member of the 1.21, 1.22 and 1.23 Release Team. In 1.22 I was the Bug Triage Lead. After my second child was born I decided to take a break from the Release Team.
