## An incomplete list of things I used to do, but don't do anymore:

- **Hannover Gophers**  
I co-organized the Hannover Gophers meetup with Tobias Pauling. Unfortunately, the pandemic forced us to discontinue the meetup.
- **nativecloud.dev**  
I collaborated with Max Körbächer to produce a weekly newsletter covering Cloud-Native Software, Culture, and Practices. After two years, we decided to conclude the newsletter to pursue other projects.
- **Kubernetes Release Team**  
I contributed to the Kubernetes Release Team and served as a member of the 1.22, 1.23, and 1.24 Release Teams. In the 1.22 cycle, I held the position of Bug Triage Lead. However, following the birth of my second child, I decided to take a break from the Release Team.
