{{< lead >}}
I am Christoph Voigt, a software engineer, consultant, manager, and entrepreneur, boasting over a decade of experience in the industry.
{{< /lead >}}

Throughout my career, I have dedicated my efforts to working with [#containers](/tags/containers/), [#kubernetes](/tags/kubernetes/), [#golang](/tags/golang/) and cloud infrastructure. Additionally, I am passionate about [#rust](/tags/rust), [#zig](/tags/zig/) and [#wasm](/tags/wasm/).

In collaboration with a group of colleagues, I co-founded **Liquid Reply GmbH**, a consultancy that specializes in cloud-provider agnostic infrastructure.

I’m based in Hannover, Germany where I reside with my two wonderful daughters and the most amazing woman I have had the fortune of finding. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧

## 👨🏼‍💻 I code.

- My expertise lies in coding across multiple languages, with a primary focus on Go.

## 🏃 I run.

- I embarked on my running journey in 2022 with the goal of completing a half-marathon. Unfortunately, my progress was hindered by illness and injuries. Consequently, I have only completed a [half-marathon unofficially so far](https://www.strava.com/activities/8079748572/overview). However, I remain determined to achieve my goal, and in the meantime, you can track my progress on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/11472957).

## 📖 I read.

- I have a deep passion for reading and have been immersed in technical books for many years. This habit started during my university days as a means to acquire free books, and I have continued it throughout my professional life.
- My all-time favourite things on the internet can be found [here](/links). If you read them and like them, tweet me and tell me! I'd love to chat about them with you.

## 📢 I talk.

- Occasionally, or when I'm really into a topic, I give talks. You can find a list of my talks [here](/talks).

## 🌐 I internet.

## An incomplete list of things I used to do, but don't do anymore:

- **Hannover Gophers**  
I co-organized the Hannover Gophers meetup with Tobias Pauling. Unfortunately, the pandemic forced us to discontinue the meetup.
- **nativecloud.dev**  
I collaborated with Max Körbächer to produce a weekly newsletter covering Cloud-Native Software, Culture, and Practices. After two years, we decided to conclude the newsletter to pursue other projects.
- **Kubernetes Release Team**  
I contributed to the Kubernetes Release Team and served as a member of the 1.22, 1.23, and 1.24 Release Teams. In the 1.22 cycle, I held the position of Bug Triage Lead. However, following the birth of my second child, I decided to take a break from the Release Team.
