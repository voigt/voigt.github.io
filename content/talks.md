**2022-04-xx - [Think container orchestration different – WASM is coming](https://devopscon.io/kubernetes-ecosystem/think-container-orchestration-different-wasm-is-coming/)**
-->


<!--
A new elephant is in the cloud native and Kubernetes room and its name is WASM (WebAssembly). The rumors are spread; if WASM was invented two years earlier, Docker would never have been born. But what does all this hype mean? Is WASM the new Docker? Why should I use it, and why I shouldn't? In this talk, Max and Chris will walk you through the current state of WASM in the cloud native ecosystem, which new possibilities it brings, and where it's just starting to crawl. You will get to know how you can use it in existing implementations like Kubernetes and which scenarios it unleashes its power by bringing new concepts.
