## Rustlang

Rust is becoming more and more relevant. I see its application in a variation of fields like Servers, WebAssembly or tools I'm invested (aurae) in. To stay relevant as well I feel that I have to become more proficient in Rust. Not on a "I know my way around the compiler", but in a "I know exactly what I'm doing" kind of way. For the majority of languages I wrote code for, I picked it up more or less "on the go". However, with Rust I notice, that I really have to sit down and take the time to study. Its work, but the nice kind of work!
