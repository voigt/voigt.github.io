## Family things

Our eldest child is about to complete her third year in school, marking an important milestone as she approaches fourth grade, which will determine the secondary school she will attend. Meanwhile, our second child just turned two and is an incredibly energetic and curious little one. She is currently in the process of learning to speak and can already form sentences consisting of two to five words.

Both my partner and I find ourselves juggling a lot as we work full-time while ensuring the well-being of our children â€” a challenge that requires careful balancing. Although we have managed to establish a routine that works for us, it feels somewhat fragile, as unexpected business trips or illness can easily disrupt our carefully crafted plans.

## Running

I am proud to say that running has finally become a regular part of my life. I now run 2-3 times a week, covering distances ranging from 15 to 30 kilometers, depending on my schedule. I am currently training for a half marathon in September and feel confident that I will be able to complete it successfully. To keep track of my progress, I use my Apple Watch to monitor and record all my runs, which I then upload to Strava. If you're interested in following my journey, you can find me there.

## WebAssembly

As I mentioned in my previous update [here](/now/2021-05-21/), my interest in WebAssembly remains unwavering. I continue to delve deeper into this topic, and it continues to captivate me.  
At Liquid Reply, we have been actively working on a project called [kwasm.sh](https://kwasm.sh/), a Kubernetes operator that installs multiple WebAssembly runtimes on the cluster. This allows users to schedule WebAssembly workloads alongside containers within the same pod manifest. It is compatible with most Kubernetes distributions, including managed services, and brings these clusters on par with Azure's Kubernetes Service.  
Additionally, I'm currently exploring other fascinating technologies such as WasmCloud and Spin (the technology powering this website). I am also closely following the development of wg-wasm, a subgroup of SIG-Runtime, with great interest.

## Rustlang

Rust is gaining increasing relevance across various domains, including servers, WebAssembly, and the tools I am personally invested in, such as aurae. In order to stay up-to-date and proficient in Rust, I feel the need to deepen my knowledge beyond a basic understanding and fighting the compiler. I aim to achieve a level of expertise where I can confidently say, "I know exactly what I'm doing." While I have acquired proficiency in most programming languages through hands-on experience, I've noticed that Rust requires a more focused and dedicated approach. It demands dedicated study and effort, but I find it to be an enjoyable and rewarding endeavor.
