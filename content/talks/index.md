## DAPR and Wasm; a Symbiosis for Polyglot Application Development  
**2024-03-19 - AppDeveloperCon Europe 2024**  
[Site](https://sched.co/1YFiq) | [Slides](/talks/DAPR_Wasm_Symbios.pdf) | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHdV7UAbyME)

There are many language agnostic frameworks to choose from when it comes to cloud-native application development, but no combination is as promising as DAPR and WebAssembly (Wasm). They have very different approaches, but they share the same goals: Code reuse, language independence, and cross-platform portability. This combination is not a new idea, and there are many ways to integrate the two technologies. Dapr even has a built-in WebAssembly engine. However, every application architecture has different characteristics. That is why we have created three blueprints that cover a wide range of use cases such as microservices, serverless, and event-driven architectures. In this talk, we will show you how to build polyglot applications tailored to your needs. You will learn how to get the most out of these amazing technologies and how to combine them to build your next cloud-native application and integrate them into your existing application landscape.

## The Buzz About Green Tech: WebAssembly's Impact on Carbon Footprint Reduction  
**2023-09-07 - WasmCon 2023**  
[Site](https://sched.co/1PiwW) | [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QlP-1H0EGePZJBFMv6ygtpTJVx5Eg7l6qCUO3ji_V-8/edit?usp=sharing) | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zi4d4Hu1HtY)

This talk aims to showcase how WebAssembly (Wasm), typically celebrated for its platform-agnostic nature and robust security, emerges as an unexpected ally in reducing the tech industry's carbon footprint.

We’ll delve into how the characteristics of Wasm and the operating models derived from it contribute to diminishing energy consumption, particularly (but not only) in data centers. Our objective is to raise awareness of Wasm's environmental advantages and encourage attendees to harness its potential in developing eco-friendly software solutions.

By the end of this talk, participants will have tangible insights into how they can leverage Wasm to not just improve application performance and compatibility but also contribute to a more sustainable digital environment.

Join us in exploring Wasm's untold green narrative and carving a sustainable future in the digital domain.

## Think Container Orchestration Different - WASM Is Coming  
**2022-04-27 - DevOpsCon UK**  
[Site](https://devopscon.io/kubernetes-ecosystem/think-container-orchestration-different-wasm-is-coming/) | [Slides](/talks/wasm-is-coming.pdf) | [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZw8xmqkKwU)

A new elephant is in the cloud native and Kubernetes room and its name is WASM (WebAssembly). The rumors are spread; if WASM was invented two years earlier, Docker would never have been born. But what does all this hype mean? Is WASM the new Docker? Why should I use it, and why I shouldn't? In this talk, Max and Chris will walk you through the current state of WASM in the cloud native ecosystem, which new possibilities it brings, and where it's just starting to crawl. You will get to know how you can use it in existing implementations like Kubernetes and which scenarios it unleashes its power by bringing new concepts.
